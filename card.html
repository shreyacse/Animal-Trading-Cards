Original bred in Belgium,
these rabbits made their way to the U.S. in the 1990s and became
officially recognized as a stand-alone breed in 2014. Lion head
has a wool mane encircling the head, reminiscent of a male lion.
 Other characteristic traits of the Lionhead include a high head
  mount, compact upright body type, short well-furred 2" - 3" ears,
   and weigh usually between 2 1/2 pounds but no more than 3 3/4 pounds.
